# Dataset Overview
Name: **UNSW-NB15 Intrusion Dataset**

Source: Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS) at UNSW Canberra

Data captured using **tcpdump** on the IXIA PerfectStorm network emulator, with both **normal** and **attack** traffic generated by various tools.

---

### What The Data Represents
Each row represents a **network flow** not an individual packet.

A **flow** (or connection) is a summary of a bidirectional communication between two hosts (identified by source/destination IPs and ports) within a specific time window.

Each flow is characterized by:
- Basic connection info (protocol, duration, etc)
- Traffic statistics (number of packets/bytes sent/received)
- TCP state indicators
- Derived features (rate, load, timing, etc)
- Contextual traffic-based features (prefix `ct_`)
- Labels indicating attack type and benign/malicious status

| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`      | Flow index                                      | Just a row identifier - not used for modeling                            |
| `dur`     | Duration of the connection (seconds)            | Long or short session might indicate scanning or DoS (Denial of Service) |
| `proto`   | Protocol type (tcp, udp, icmp, etc)             | Malicious flows often use TCP/UDP, while ICMP may indicate ping sweeps   |
| `service` | Application-level service (e.g. http, ftp, dns) | Certain attacks target specific services                                 |
| `state`   | Connection state (S0, S1, FIN, etc)             | FIN/S0 states can signal incomplete handshakes or scans                  |

#### Flow Volume & Packet Features
| Column             | Description                                                                                                   | Cybersecurity Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `spkts`, `dpkts`   | Number of packets sent and received. spkts (source packets / sent) and dpkts (destination packets / recieved) | Imbalance (e.g., many sent, few received) may suggest scanning or flooding. If spkts is much larger, could indicate scanning or probing (source sends many requests, destination barely responds). dpkts is much larger could indicate flooding or DoS-like behavior |
| `sbytes`, `dbytes` | Bytes sent and recieved                                                                                       | Large byte count in one direction may mean data exfiltration                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### IP/TCP Header Features
| Column                       | Description                                                                                                             | Cybersecurity Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sttl`, `dttl`               | Source and destination TTL values.

TTL is a counter that decreases by 1 each time a packet passes through a router. When it reaches 0, the packet is discarded. (prevents infinite packet loops)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `swin`, `dwin`               | TCP window sizes. swin (source window size) and dwin (destination window size)                                          | Manipulated windows can be part of evasion techniques. TCP window size represents how much data the sender or receiver is willing to accept before requiring an acknowledgement. Larger window size means higher throughput potential                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `stcpb`, `dtcpb`             | TCP base sequence numbers. stcpb (source TCP base sequence number) and dtcpb (destination TCP base sequence number)     | Sequence anomalies may appear in crafted packets. Represents the initial sequence number (ISN) chosen by the source or destination host when establishing a TCP connection. In TCP every byte of data is numbered and the ISN is the starting point.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `tcprtt`, `synack`, `ackdat` | TCP timing measures (RTT, handshake times). tcprtt (TCP round trip time). synack (SYN ACK time). ackdat (ACK data time) | Can indicate delays or manipulation at the TCP layer. tcprtt measures the average time for packets round trip in a flow and these values are normally stable. synack measures the time between sending a SYN packet (connection request) and recieving the SYN-ACK response from the destination and are normally short and consistent. ackdat measures the time between sending an ACK packet and receiving data from the destination and is usually very quick |

| `response_body_len` | HTTP response body length                        | Long responses might mean file downloads or data exfiltration  |

#### "CT" Contextual Features (Critical For ML)
These are connection tracking or contextual traffic features - they capture patterns over time, not just a single flow.

### Theoretical (What To Expect)
|Hypothesis|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Short-duration, low-byte flows** → likely reconnaissance|Port scanning often results in many short, failed connections.|
|**High `rate` or `sload` values** → DoS or flood behavior|Sustained high throughput and low response bytes.|
|**High asymmetry (`sbytes` ≫ `dbytes`)** → data exfiltration|More data leaving than entering.|
|**Repeated service usage (`ct_srv_src` high)** → brute-force|Repeated attempts on same service from same host.|
|**Abnormal TCP states (`state` = S0, S1, REJ)** → scanning|Incomplete handshakes indicate reconnaissance.|
|**High `tcprtt` or jitter** → evasion or congestion|Attack traffic may not follow natural timing.|
|**Same IP/port combinations (`is_sm_ips_ports`=1)** → spoofing/test traffic|Rare in normal usage.|
